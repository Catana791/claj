- auto room hosting to the nearest server
- move Mindustry client/server implementation to another repo (claj-mindustry)
- There is an issue with the server on room host side, it's keep closing connections for no reasons.
  There are no errors in every sides, so pretty difficult to find the problem.
  Need to investigate more and reverse-engineering more the Mindustry protocol.
