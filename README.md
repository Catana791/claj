# Copy Link and Join (CLaJ)
This system allow you to play with your friends just by creating a room, copy the link, send it to your friends.

This is a bundled and optimized version of the [CLaJ server](https://github.com/xzxADIxzx/Copy-Link-and-Join) and stripped down version of the [xzxADIxzx's Scheme-Size mod](https://github.com/xzxADIxzx/Scheme-Size).


## How to use
### Client
Start and host a map as normal (or your campaign): ``Host Multiplayer Game`` **>** ``Host``. <br>
Then go to ``Manage CLaJ Rooms``, select a server (or add your own), after ``Create Room`` **>** ``Copy Link`` and send the copied link to your friends.

To join, it's simple, copy the link your friend sent you, open your game, go to ``Play`` **>** ``Join Game`` **>** ``Join via CLaJ``, paste the link and press ``Join``. <br>
Now, if all goods, you can play with your friends, so enjoy =).


### Server
> [!NOTE]
> The server version is not a plugin, this is a custom server.
