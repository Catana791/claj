# CLaJ-Client
CLaJ (Copy Link and Join) allow you to play with your friends just by creating a room, copy the link, send it to your friends.

This is a stripped down version of the [xzxADIxzx's Scheme-Size mod](https://github.com/xzxADIxzx/Scheme-Size) (that include this feature), but just with the CLaJ feature, not the unwanted rest. With redesign, optimizations and updatable CLaJ servers list.


## How to use
Start a map as normal (or your campain), press ``Host Multiplayer Game`` **>** ``Host`` , then ``Manage CLaJ Rooms``, select a room server (or add your own if you host one) and press ``Create Room``. <br>
Now press ``Copy Link`` and send it to your friends.

To join, it's simple, just copy the link your friend sent you, open your game, go to ``Play`` **>** ``Join Game`` **>** ``Join via CLaJ``, paste the link and press ``Join``. <br>
Now, if all goods, you can play with your friends, so enjoy =).
